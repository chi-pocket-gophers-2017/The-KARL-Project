Pull requests will be reviewed and merged by another team member, with comments aded where appropriate.

Any Pull Requests that alter or include a view should include a corresponding screenshot.

As far as style: you should refer to the AirBnB Style guides for both Ruby & JavaScript.

Every Pull Request to master should work; Master should never be a failing or faulty.

Git pushes should be done Atomically: They should be full, working features, that are able to function on their own.
  - Meaning that they shouldn't rely on code coming in from a later push.
